  			<p>The least little bit can do so much. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Let's get crazy.</p>

  			<p>I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. This is unplanned it really just happens. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

  			<p>Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. It's cold, but it's beautiful. You need the dark in order to show the light. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.</p>
  			<img class = "painting" src = "mtnmaj15.jpg">
  			<p>Just use the old one inch brush. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.</p>

<!--    <h1>Cats!</h1>

   <div>
   <p>Dream about hunting birds you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me sniff all the things and i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box. Rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent scratch the furniture but claw drapes lick the curtain just to be annoying or being gorgeous with belly side up. Meoooow prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark or lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep. Poop in litter box, scratch the walls purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table. 
   </p>

   <p>Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun but scamper, and find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day so bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together. Destroy the blinds chase laser put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed chase imaginary bugs. Dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain. 
   </p>

   <p> Need to chase tail shake treat bag, and steal the warm chair right after you get up meow in empty rooms yet hiss at vacuum cleaner. Pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now wack the mini furry mouse touch water with paw then recoil in horror.   </p>

   <p> Sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum throwup on your pillow, so chase the pig around the house swat turds around the house meowzer. Burrow under covers. Give me some of your food give me some of your food give me some of your food meh, i don't want it mewl for food at 4am or sit on human they not getting up ever or pretend you want to go out but then don't see owner, run in terror purr while eating.</p> -->
